**Hey** *let's load some data*  

```{r}
data(airquality)

head(airquality)
```

What about a few plots  
1. Ozone vs. Solar Radiation  
2. Ozone vs. Month  

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Ozone ~ Solar.R, airquality)
plot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality)
```

Add a regression  

```{r}
library(stats)
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, airquality)

with(airquality, plot(Solar.R, Ozone, pch = 15, main = "Airquality correlation to Solar Radiance"))
abline(model, lwd = 1, col = "red")
legend(x=25, y=160, pch = 15, bty = "o", col = "red", legend = "Regression Line")
```
